# Charybdis Mini (3x6) default keymap

The Charydbis Mini (3x6) default keymap is inspired from the original [Dactyl Manuform](../../../../../handwired/dactyl_manuform) default keymap.

This layout works with an alternate Combo creation system from http://combos.gboards.ca/. This system makes for creating combos to be much simpler, and is great when using combos heavily and when experimenting with different combos.

This layout also features macros that are OS dependent. Default OS is Mac, and there is a swap OS key in the Mouse layer. Code for this was taken from https://github.com/alvaro-prieto/corne
